# CoE pulse

### Summary

The CoE pulse helps you understand how well the CoE is performing by asking for feedback from your maker community. This information is key to ensuring that the CoE meets the needs and expectations of your makers.

Simple by design, it randomly selects a maker from a Dataverse table each day, sending them an invitation for feedback. When given, the feedback is analysed by two AI Builder, prebuilt models:  sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction. This data, over time provides your organisation with key information about CoE performance.
